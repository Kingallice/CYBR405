<h2>Tapenade Recipe (Olive Spread)</h2>
<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:<blockquote>“Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to roomtemperaturebefore you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.”</blockquote></p>	
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
	<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
	<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
	<li>1 t. capers</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
