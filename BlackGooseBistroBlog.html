	<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
	<p><small>Posted by BGB, <time datetime="11-15-2012">Novemeber 15, 2012</time></small></p>
	<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

	<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.</p>

	<p>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="11-30-2012">November 30</time>.</p>

	<p>Location: <br>Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA </p>
	<p>Hours: <br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to Midnight</p>
